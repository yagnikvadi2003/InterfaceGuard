/**
 * @file paths.mjs
 * @description Utility file for defining key project paths and public URL handling.
 *
 * @details
 * This module centralizes and exports all essential paths used throughout the project 
 * for easier maintenance and configuration. Paths are dynamically resolved based on 
 * the projectâ€™s root directory and environment variables. It also handles the setup 
 * for public URL resolution for both development and production environments.
 *
 * Key functionalities:
 * 1. Define and resolve critical project paths, such as the source, build, public, and 
 *    node modules directories.
 * 2. Manage the paths to various configuration files such as `tsconfig.json`, `jsconfig.json`,
 *    and lock files (yarn, pnpm).
 * 3. Dynamically resolve the entry point for JavaScript or TypeScript (`appIndexJs`) based 
 *    on the file extensions configured.
 * 4. Expose `publicUrlOrPath` utility for determining the correct public URL or path in 
 *    development and production modes.

 *
 * @usage
 * - Import this module to retrieve any essential project paths for use in configuration files 
 *   like Webpack, Babel, or TypeScript.
 * - Modify `resolveApp()` calls to adjust the base paths as needed for your project's structure.
 *
 * @note
 * Ensure that the `buildPath` and `publicUrlOrPath` environment variables are correctly set 
 * for production builds to avoid issues with the deployment base path.
