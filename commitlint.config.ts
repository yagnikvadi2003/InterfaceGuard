/**
 * @file commitlint.config.ts
 * @description Commitlint configuration file for enforcing conventional commit messages
 *
 * @details
 * This configuration file is responsible for defining the rules and settings 
 * for commit message validation using Commitlint. It extends the conventional 
 * commit style and includes custom rules to enforce standards in commit 
 * messages. The configuration helps ensure that commit messages are structured, 
 * informative, and consistent across the project.
 *
 * Key functionalities:
 * 1. Extend @commitlint/config-conventional for standard rules.
 * 2. Set up parser and formatter presets to handle commit message parsing 
 *    and formatting.
 * 3. Define custom rules for commit message types, body casing, and length limits.
 * 4. Specify messages and prompts for user interactions during commit message 
 *    creation.
 * 5. Allow ignoring empty commit messages and provide a help URL for guidance.

 * @author Yagnik Vadi<yagnik.infineit2003@gmail.com>
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @created 2024-08-27
 * @updated 2024-09-26
 *
 * @usage
 * - Adjust the rules and prompts as necessary to fit the project's commit 
 *   message style and requirements.
 * - Ensure that referenced packages (e.g., @commitlint/config-conventional, 
 *   conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits) are installed in the project.
 *
 * @note
 * Commitlint will enforce these rules during the commit process, and any 
 * violations will result in an error, prompting the user to revise their 
 * commit message accordingly.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint for more information 
 * on configuring Commitlint and understanding commit message conventions.
